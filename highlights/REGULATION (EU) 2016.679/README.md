1.   Where processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, `the controller shall use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate 
technical and organisational measures` in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data 
subject.

`So, in order to guarantee that, they are requesting for the TOM. However,`

3.   Processing by a processor `shall be governed by a contract` or other legal act under Union or Member State law, that is binding on the processor with regard to the 
controller and that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of 
data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. That contract or other legal act shall stipulate, in particular, that the processor:
(c) takes all measures required pursuant to [Article 32](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&qid=1690272173050#d1e3383-1-1);

1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying 
likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, `the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational 
measures` to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate:

(a) the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;

(b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;

(c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;

(d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.

2. In `assessing the appropriate level of security` account shall be taken in particular of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental 
or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.

3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification mechanism as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element 
by which to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article.

4. The controller and processor shall take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor who has access to 
personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller, unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law.

## Art. 33 [Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&qid=1690272173050#d1e3434-1-1)

1. Where a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to 
result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the 
envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data. A single assessment may address a set of similar processing operations that present similar high 
risks.

## Art. 58 [Powers](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&qid=1690272173050#d1e5059-1-1)

1.   Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, every data subject shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority,
