### AT 2 Subject matter
#### AT 2.2 Risks

1. The requirements set forth in this Circular relate to the management of an institution’s material risks. `In order to assess whether or not a risk is material, the management board shall`, regularly and on an ad hoc basis, `gain an overview of the risks faced by the institution in the context of a risk inventory (overall risk profile)`. The risks shall be captured at the level of the institution as a whole irrespective of the organisational unit in which they were caused.
In principle, at least the following risks shall be considered material:

- a) counterparty and credit risk (including country risk),
- b) market risk,
- c) liquidity risk, and
- d) `operational risk.`

The risk concentrations associated with material risks shall likewise be taken into account. Appropriate arrangements shall be made for any risks which are not considered material.

2. In the context of the risk inventory, `the institution shall examine which risks may materially impair its financial position (including its capital resources), financial performance or liquidity position.`The risk inventory should not focus exclusively on the impact on the institution’s accounting or on *de jure* views`.

**Holistic risk inventory** 

The risk inventory shall also take account of risks arising from off-balance-sheet entities (eg risks from special-purpose entities not subject to consolidation). Depending on the institution’s specific overall risk profile, other risks, such as reputational risks, should be considered material, where appropriate.

#### AT 3 Joint responsibility of the management board members 
2. `Irrespective of the management board’s joint responsibility` for ensuring an institution’s proper business organisation and, in particular, appropriate and effective risk
management, `each management board member shall be responsible for ensuring that appropriate control and monitoring processes are put in place within his/her respective area of responsibility`.

**Risk culture**
The risk culture refers in general to the manner in which the institution’s staff (should)
deal with risks in the course of their duties. The risk culture should promote the identification and conscious handling of risks and ensure that decision-making processes lead
to outcomes that are balanced also from a risk perspective. An appropriate risk culture
is characterised above all by the management board’s clear commitment to risk-appropriate behaviour, strict compliance by all staff with the risk appetite communicated by
the management board and the facilitation and promotion of a transparent and open
dialogue on risk-related issues within the institution.

### AT 4 General risk management requirements
#### AT 4.1 Internal capital adequacy

1. Based on their overall risk profile,  institutions shall ensure that their material risks,
taking account of risk concentrations, are constantly covered by available financial
resources (risk coverage potential), thus maintaining internal capital adequacy.

**Aggregation of immaterial risks**
`If a number of risks are classified individually as immaterial but are material in total`,
the procedures used to ensure internal capital adequacy must guarantee that these
aggregated risks are taken into account in an appropriate manner.

4. Institutions `shall specify any material risks that are not included in the internal capital
adequacy concept`. The exclusion of a material risk shall be plausibly substantiated
and shall be permissible only if the risk in question cannot be meaningfully limited by
means of available financial resources (risk coverage potential) owing to its specific
nature (eg illiquidity risk). It shall be ensured that such risks are appropriately factored
into the risk management and risk control processes.

5. `If an institution does not have any suitable methods for quantifying individual risks
that are to be included in the internal capital adequacy concept, it shall set a reasonable risk amount for these risks based on a plausibility check. The plausibility check
can be conducted using a qualified expert judgement`.

### AT 4.3 Internal control system
#### AT 4.3.1 Organisational and operational structure

When designing the organisational and operational structure  it shall be ensured that activities that are not compatible with each other are performed by different staff members
and that conflicts of interest are avoided also when staff members change posts`. If staff of trading or front office units move to back office units and control units, appropriate cooling-off periods shall be applied to activities that violate the ban on self-audit and self-review.

**Back office units and control units**
Back office units and control units within the meaning of this number are:
- risk control function,
- compliance function,
- back office,
- settlement and control.
If the cooling-off periods would lead to a disproportionate delay in operating procedures, smaller, less complex institutions may establish alternative, appropriate control
mechanisms.

`Processes as well as the related tasks, competencies, responsibilities, controls and reporting channels shall be clearly defined and coordinated`. `Rights and competencies shall be
assigned on a need-to-know basis and shall be swiftly adjusted, where necessary`. This shall include regular and ad hoc reviews of IT access rights, authorities to sign and other competencies that have been assigned within appropriate periods of time. The periods of time shall depend on the significance of the processes and, in the case of IT access rights, on the protection requirements of the processed data. The same shall apply to interfaces to material outsourced activities and processes.

**Reviewing rights and competencies**
Access rights in connection with transaction accounts and material IT access rights shall
be reviewed at least annually, and all others at least every three years. Especially critical
IT access rights, such as those held by administrators, shall be reviewed at least every
six months.

#### AT 4.3.2 Risk management and risk control processes
1. Each institution shall establish appropriate `risk management and risk control processes` in order to ensure that the material risks and associated risk
concentrations are
- (a) identified,
- (b) assessed,
- (c) managed,
- (d) monitored and reported.
These processes shall be factored into an integrated performance and risk management (Gesamtbanksteuerung). `Suitable measures shall be
taken to ensure that the risks and associated risk concentrations are effectively limited and monitored`, taking internal capital adequacy and risk
appetite into account.

2 The risk management and risk control processes shall ensure that the material risks – including risks resulting from outsourced activities and processes – can be identified early, fully captured and adequately presented.
To this end, `the institution shall derive suitable indicators for the early identification both of risks and of potential consequences across different
types of risk`, which are based on quantitative and/or qualitative risk features depending on the nature of the risk type concerned.

### AT 4.4 Special functions
#### AT 4.4.1 Risk control function

2. In particular, the risk control function shall perform the following tasks:
- support the management board in all risk policy issues, in particular in developing and implementing the risk strategy and evolving a risk limitation system,
- carry out the risk inventory and draw up the overall risk profile,
- support the management board in developing and improving the risk management and risk control processes,
- `develop and improve a system of risk ratios and a procedure for the early detection of risks`,
- monitor the institution’s risk situation and internal capital adequacy as well as
compliance with the risk limits in place on an ongoing basis,
- draw up the regular risk reports for the management board,
- `assume responsibility for the processes for passing on material risk-related ad hoc information promptly to the management board, the responsible officers
and, where applicable, the internal audit function`.

3 Staff of the risk control function shall be granted all necessary powers and unrestricted access to all information needed to perform their tasks. In particular, this shall
include unrestricted access at all times to the institution’s risk data.
