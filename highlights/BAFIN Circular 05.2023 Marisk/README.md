#### AT 2.2 Risks

1. The requirements set forth in this Circular relate to the management of an institution’s material risks. `In order to assess whether or not a risk is material, the management board shall`, regularly and on an ad hoc basis, `gain an overview of the risks faced by the institution in the context of a risk inventory (overall risk profile)`. The risks shall be captured at the level of the institution as a whole irrespective of the organisational unit in which they were caused.
In principle, at least the following risks shall be considered material:

- a) counterparty and credit risk (including country risk),
- b) market risk,
- c) liquidity risk, and
- d) `operational risk.`

The risk concentrations associated with material risks shall likewise be taken into account. Appropriate arrangements shall be made for any risks which are not considered material.

2. In the context of the risk inventory, `the institution shall examine which risks may materially impair its financial position (including its capital resources), financial performance or liquidity position.`The risk inventory should not focus exclusively on the impact on the institution’s accounting or on *de jure* views`.

**Holistic risk inventory** 

The risk inventory shall also take account of risks arising from off-balance-sheet entities (eg risks from special-purpose entities not subject to consolidation). Depending on the institution’s specific overall risk profile, other risks, such as reputational risks, should be considered material, where appropriate.
