#### AT 2.2 Risks

1. The requirements set forth in this Circular relate to the management of an institutionâ€™s material risks. `In order to assess whether or not a risk is material, the management board shall`, regularly and on an ad hoc basis, `gain an overview of the risks faced by the institution in the context of a risk inventory (overall risk profile)`. The risks shall be captured at the level of the institution as a whole irrespective of the organisational unit in which they were caused.
In principle, at least the following risks shall be considered material:

- a) counterparty and credit risk (including country risk),
- b) market risk,
- c) liquidity risk, and
- d) `operational risk.`

  
The risk concentrations associated with material risks shall likewise be taken into account. Appropriate arrangements shall be made for any risks which are not considered material.
